In what follows we shall be \textit{questioning} concerning technology. Questioning builds a way. We would be advised, therefore, above all to pay heed to the way, and not to fix our attention on isolated sentences and topics. The way is a way of thinking. All ways of thinking (ahaha), more or less perceptibly, lead through language in a manner that is extraoridnary. We shall be questioning concerning \textit{technology}, and in doing so we should like to prepare a free relationship to it. The relationship will be free if it opens our human existence to the essence of technology. When we can respond to this essence, we shall be able to experience the technological within its own bounds.

Technology is not equivalent to the essence of technology. When we are seeking the essence of ``tree", we have to become aware that That which pervades every tree, as tree, is not itself a tree thta can be encountered among all the other trees.

Likewise, the essence of technology is by no means anything technological. Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst way possible when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we are particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.

According to ancient doctrine, the essence of thing is considered to be \textit{what} the thing is. We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is. Everyone knows the two statements that answe rour question. One says: Technology is a means to an end. The other says: Technology is a human activity. The two definitions of technology belong together. For to posit ends and procure and utilize the means to them is a human activity. The manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools, and machines, the manufactured and used things themselves, and the needs and ends that they serve -- all belong to what technology is. The whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance, or, in latin, an \textit{instrumentum}.

The current conception of technology, according to which it is a means and human activity, can therefore be called the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology.

Who would ever call this incorrect? It obviously conforms with what we envision when we talk about technology. The instrumental definition of technology is in fact so uncannily correct that it even holds for modern technology, of which, in other respects, we maintain with some justification that it is, in contrast to the older handwork technology, something completely different and therefore new. Even the power plant with its turbines and generators is a man-made means to an end established by man. Even the jet aircraft and the high-frequency radio are means to ends. A radar station is of course less simple than a weather vane. To be sure, the construction of a high-frequency device requires the interlocking of various processes of technical-industrial production. And certainly a sawmill in a secluded valley of the Black Forest is a primitive means compared with the hydroelectric plant in the Rhine River.
the distinctive expression of the cognitive or intellectual character of a culture or social group.

But this much remains correct: modern technology too is a means to an end. That is why the instrumental conception of technology conditions every attempt to bring man into the right relation to technology. Everything depends on our manipulating technology in the rightly as a means. We will, as we say, "get" technology "spirtutally in hand". We will master it. The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent the more technology threatens to slip from human control.

Supposing that technology is not merely means, how does that square with the will to master it? Did we not say that the definition of technology as an instrument is correct? Certainly. The correct always fixes upon something suitable in whatever is under consideration. However, in order to be correct, this 'fixing' needs not to uncover the essence of the thing in question. Only at the point when the essential uncovering happens does the 'true' become known. This is why the merely correct is not yet also the 'true'. Only the true brings us into a free relationship with that of its (technology's) essence that concerns us. Thus, the correct technical definition of technology does not show us technology's essence. So that we may arrive at this essence, or at least come close to it, we will find the true by way of the correct. We must ask: What is the technical itself? Within what do such things as 'means' and 'ends' belong? A means is where something is precipitated and hence attained. Whatever has an 'effect' as its consequence is called a cause. But not just the means that cause 'effect' are a cause. The end, by lending to the determination of which \textit{type} of means will be used, is also considered a cause. Wherever ends are pursued and means employed, wherever technicality reigns, there reigns also causality.

For centuries philosophy has taught that there are four causes: (1) the \textit{causa materialis} (material cause), the matter from which, for example, a silver chalice is made; (2) the \textit{cause formalis} (formal cause), the form, the shape the material forms; (3) the \textit{causa finalis} (final cause), the end or goal, for example, the relationship between the chalice and sacrificial rite which determines the necessary form and material for it; (4) the \textit{causa efficiens} (efficient cause), which brings about the \textit{effect} that is the finished, actual chalice -- in this case, the silversmith. What technology is, understood as means, reveals itself when we trace technicality back to the four 'causalities'.

Should we suppose that causality, for its part, is veiled in darkness as to what it actually is? No doubt, for centuries we have acted as though the doctrine of the four causes had fallen from heaven, a truth as clear as day. But maybe the time has come to ask: Why only four causes? In context of the aforementioned four, what does "cause" really mean? How did we arrive at the singular determination that the \textit{character} of the four causes is such that they belong together?

As long as we avoid these questions, causality, and with it technicality, and with technicality the accepted definition of technology, remain obscure and groundless.

We are long accustomed to understanding 'cause' as that which brings something else about. In this connotation, to 'bring something about' means to obtain results or effects. The \textit{causa efficiens}, just one among the four causes, thus sets the standard for our understanding of 'causality'. This interpretation carries so far that we no longer even count the \textit{causa finalis}, end finality, as causality. \textit{Causa}, \textit{casus}, belongs to the verb \textit{cadere}, ``to fall," and can be defined as ``that which brings about the result, that something falls out in such and such a way". The doctrine of the four causes goes back to Aristotle. But everything that later ages look to find in Greek thought under the conception and rubric ``causality," as Greek thought per se had nothing at all to do with bringing about and effecting. What we call cause [\textit{Ursache}] and the Romans call /{causa} is called \textit{aition} by the Greeks, which meant ``that to which something else is indebted". The four causes are the method, indebted simultaneously to each other, of being responsible for something else. An example will help here.

The silver chalice is made out of silver. As this substance (\textit{hyle}), it is co-responsible for the chalice. The chalice is indebted to, i.e., owes thanks to, the silver that it is made from. But the sacrificial vessel, the chalice, is indebted not only to the silver material. As a chalice, that which is indebted to the silver appears in the shape of a chalice, not as a brooch or a ring. The sacrificial vessel is simultaneously indebted to the idea (\textit{eidos}) of chaliceness. Both the silver into which the shape is formed as chalice and the shape in which the silver appears are in their respective ways co-responsible for the sacrificial vessel.

There is yet a third participant that has utmost responsiblity for the sacrificial vessel. This participant is that which restricts the chalice to the domain of consecration and bestowal. Through this the chalice is defined as sacrificial vessel. Definition gives bounds to the object. These bounds do not stop the object; rather from out of them it begins to be what, after production, it will be. That which gives bounds, that which completes, in this sense is called in Greek \textit{telos} -- all too often traslated as ``aim" or ``purpose," and so misinterpreted. The \textit{telos} is responsible for what as matter and for what as shape are together co-responsible for the sacrificial vessel.

Finally there is a fourth participant in the responsibility for the finished sacrificial vessel lying before us ready for use, i.e., the silversmith -- but not because he, in working, brings about the finished sacrficial chalice, as if it were the effect of a making; the silversmith is not a \textit{causa efficiens}.

The Aristolian doctrine neither knows the cause that is named by this term nor uses a Greek word that would correspond to it.

The silversmith carefully considers and brings together the other three ways of being responsible and indebted. To carefully consider is in Greek \textit{legein}, \textit{logos}. \textit{Legein} is rooted in \textit{apophainesthai}, to bring forward into appearance. The silversmith is co-responsible as that from which the sacrificial vessel's 'bringing forth' and being-in-self take and keep their first deviation. The three previously mentioned means of responsiblity are indebted to the ponderous consideration of the silversmith for the ``that" and the ``how" of their coming to appear and to play in the production of the sacrificial vessel.

Thus these four responsiblities predominate in the sacrifical vessel that lies finished before us. They differ from each other, yet belong together. What unites them from the beginning? In what does this unified performance of the four responsibilities play? What is the source of the unity of the four causes? What, after all, does this debt and responsibility mean, viewed as the Greeks thought it? 

Today we are too willing to either understand responsiblity and indebtedness as a moral lapse, or else interpret them in terms of effecting. In either case, we bar ourselves from the way to the primal meaning of that which is to be called causality. So long as this way is closed to us we shall also fail to see what technicality, which is based on causality, actually is.

In order to guard against such misinterpretations of responsiblity and indebtedness, let us clarify the four responsiblities in terms of that for which they are responsible. According to our example, they are together responsible for the silver chalice lying finished before us as a sacrificial vessel. Lying before and lying finished (\textit{hypokeisthai}) characterize the 'manifestation' of something that manifests. The four responsiblities, together, bring something into being. They let it come forth into 'manifestation'. They set it free and start it on its way, namely, into its complete arrival. The principal characteristic of responsiblity is this 'starting something on its way into arrival'. It is in the sense of such a 'starting something on its way to arrival' that responsiblity is an occasioning, an inducement to go forward. Based on observation of what the Greeks experienced with regards to responsiblity, in \textit{aitia}, we can give the verb ``to occasion" a more inclusive meaning, thus it now is the name for the essence of causality viewed as the Greeks thought it. The common and narrower meaning of ``occasion" in contrast is nothing more than striking against and releasing, and means a kind of secondary cause within the whole causality.

But in what, then, does the unified performance of the four ways of occasioning play? These ways let what is not yet present arrive into manifestation. As such, they are singularly governed by a \texit{bringing} that brings what manifests into being. Plato tells us what this bringing is in this sentence of the \textit{Symposium} (205b): \textit{h\-{e} gar toi ek tou m\-{e} onton eis to on ionti hot\-{o}ioun aitia pasa esti poi\-{e}sis}. ``Every occasion for whatever passes over and goes on into manifestation from that which is not manifested is \textit{poi\-{e}sis}, is bringing-forth."

It is of utmost importance that we understand bringing-forth both in its full scope and also in the sense that the Greeks understood it. Not just handcraft manufacture, not just artistic and poetical bringing into being and concrete imagery, is a bringing-forth, \textit{poi\-{e}sis}. \testit{Physis} also, the arising of something from out of itself, is a bringing-forth, \textit{poi\-{e}sis}. \textit{Physis} is indeed \textit{poi\-{e}sis} in the highest sense. For what manifests by means of \textit{physis} has the same bursting open of bringing-forth, e.g., the bursting of a blossom into bloom, in itself (\textit{en heaut\-{o}i}). In contrast, what is brought forth by the artisan or the artist, e.g., the silver chalice, has the bursting open of bringing-forth not in itself, but in another (\textit{en all\-{o}i}), in the craftsman or artist.

The modes of occasioning, the four causes, are at play, then, in bringing-forth. Through bringing-forth, the growing things of nature as well as whatever is finished through arts and crafts arrive to their being.

But how does bringing-forth happen, in nature or in handwork or in art? What is this bringing-forth that the fourfold way of 'occasioning' plays within? 'Occasioning' concerns the manifestation of that which comes to being in bringing-forth. Bringing-forth brings hither out of concealment, forth to un-concealment. Bringing-forth comes to pass only insofar as something concealed comes to be un-concealed. This coming exists and moves freely within what we call revealing. The Greeks have the word \textit{al\-{e}theia} for revealing. The Romans translate this with \textit{veritas}. We say ``truth" and usually understand it as the correctness of an idea.



Yet where have we strayed to? We started with questions concerning technology, and now we have arrived at \textit{al\-{e}theia}, at revealing. What does the essence of technology have to do with revealing? The answer: everything. Because every bringing-forth is rooted in revealing. Bringing-forth, indeed, gathers within itself the four modes of occasioning -- causality -- and governs them throughout. Within its (bringing-forth's) domain belong end and means, belongs technicality. Technicality is considered to be the fundamental characteristic of technology. If we inquire, step by step, into what technology, represented as means, actually is, then we will arrive at revealing. The possibility of all productive manufacturing lies in revealing.

Technology is no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we pay attention to this, then another entire domain for the essence of technology will open itself to us. It is the domain of revealing, i.e., of truth.

This possibility strikes us as strange. Indeed, it should do so, should do so as persistently as possible and with so much urgency that we will finally take seriously the simple question of what the name ``technology" means. The word stems from the Greek. \textit{Technikon} means that which belongs to \textit{techn\-{e}}. We should note two things about the meaning of this word. One is that \textit{techn\-{e}} is the name not only for the activities and skills of the craftsman, but also for the arts of the mind and the fine arts. \textit{Techn\-{e}} belongs to bringing-forth, to \{poi\-{e}sis}; it is something poietic.

The other point that we should note about \textit{techn\-{e}} is even more important. From the earliest times up until Plato the word \textit{techn\-{e}} is linked with the word \textit{epist\-{e}m\-{e}}. Both words are names for knowing in the widest sense. They mean to be entirely at home in something, to understand and be an expert in it. Such knowing provides an opening up. As an opening up it is a revealing. Aristotle, in a discussion of special importance (\textit{Nichomachean Ethics}, Bk. VI, chaps. 3 and 4), distinguishes between \textit{epist\-{e}m\-{e}} and \textit{techn\-{e}}, with respect to what and how they reveal. \textit{Techn\-{e}} is a mode of \textit{al\-{e}theuein}. It reveals whatever does not bring itself forth and does not yet exist here before us, whatever can look and turn out now one way and now another. Whoever builds a house or a ship or forges a sacrificial chalice reveals what is to be brought forth, according to the four ways of 'occasioning'. This revealing gathers together in advance the form and the material of ship or house, with a vision of the thing completed, and from this gathering determines the manner of its construction. What is decisive in \textit{techn\-{e}} does not lie at all in making and manipulating nor in the using of means, but rather in the aforementioned revealing. It is as revealing, and not as manufacturing, that \textit{techn\-{e}} is a bringing-forth.

The clue then to what \textit{techn\-{e}} means and to how the Greeks defined it leads us to the same context that opened to us when we pursued the question of what technicality, as such, truthfully, might be.

Technology is a way of revealing. Technology manifests in the domain where revealing and un-concealment take place, where \textit{al\-{e}thia}, truth, happens.

One can object to this definition of the essential domain of technology that it indeed holds for Greek thought and that at best it might apply to the techniques of the handcraftsman, but that it simply does not fit modern machine-powered technology. It is precisely this objection, and it alone, that is the distrubing thing, that moves us to ask the question concerning technology per se. It is said that modern technology is something incomparably different from all earlier technologies because it is based on modern physics as an exact science. Meanwhile, we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: Modern physics, as experimental, is dependent upon technical apparatus and upon progress in the building of apparatus. The establishment of this mutual relationship between technology and physics is correct. But it remains a merely historiographical establishment of facts and says nothing about what this mutual relationship is grounded in. The decisive question still remains: what is the essence of modern technology such that it happens to think of putting exact science to use?

What is modern technology? It too is a revealing. Only when we rest our attention on this fundamental characteristic does what is new in modern technology reveal itself to us. 

And yet the revealing that predominates throughout modern technology does not unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense of \textit{po\-{e}sis}. The revealing that dominates in modern technology is a \texit{challenging}, which unreasonably demands from nature a supply of energy that can be extracted and stored as such. But is this not true for the old windmill as well? No. The windmill's sails do indeed turn in the wind; in fact they are left entirely to the wind's blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.

In contrast, a tract of land is exacted into putting out coal and ore. The earth now reveals itself as a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral desposit. The field that the peasant formerly cultivated and settled appears differently than it did when 'to settle' still meant to take care of and to maintain. The work of the peasant does not exact the soil of the field. By sowing the grain, the peasant places the seed into the care of the forces of growth and watches over its development. But meanwhile even the cultivation of the field has incurred another kind of 'settling', which \textit{settles} upon nature. It settles upon it in the sense of exacting it. Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now settled upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, for example; uranium is settled to yield atomic energy, which can be released either for destruction or for peaceful use.

This settling that exacts the energies of nature is an acceleration, in two ways. It accelerates in that it unlocks and exposes. Yet that acceleration is itself always directed, from the outset, toward furthering something else, i.e., toward driving out the maximum yield at the minimum expense. The coal that has been hauled out in some mining district has not been supplied so that it may simply be \textit{present} somewhere or other. It is stockpiled; that is, it is on call, ready to deliver the sun's warmth that is stored in it. The sun's warmth is exacted for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running.

The hydroelectric plant is settled into the Rhine river's current. It sets the Rhine to supplying hydraulic pressure, which then sets the turbines turning. This turning sets machines in motion, machines whose thrust gets going the electric current for which the long-distance power relay station and its network of cables are set up to dispatch electricity. Viewed in this context of interlocking processes stemming from the orderly dispersal of electrical energy, even the Rhine itself appears as something at our command. The hydroelectric plant is not built into the Rhine River the same way as was the old wooden bridge that joined bank with bank for hundreds of years. Rather, the river is dammed up into the power plant. What the river is now, namely, a water power supplier, is derived from the essence of the power station. So that we may understand the monstrousness that reigns here, let us consider for a moment the contrast between the two titles, ``The Rhine" as dammed up into \textit{power} works, and ``The Rhine" as uttered out of the \textit{art} work, in H\"{o}lderlin's hymn by that name. But, it will be replied, the Rhine is still a river in the landscape, is it not? Perhaps. But how? In no other way than as an object on call for inspection by a tour group ordered there by the vacation industry.

The revealing that governs throughout modern technology has the character of a settling, in the sense of an exaction. That exaction happens in that the energy concealed in nature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what is transformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed and what is distributed is switched about ever anew. Unlocking, transforming, storing, distributing, and switching about are ways of revealing. But the revealing never simply comes to an end. Nor does it run off into the indeterminate. The revealing reveals to itself its own manifoldly interlocking paths, through regulating the interlocking paths' course. This regulating itself is, for its part, everywhere attached. Regulating and attaching become the chief characterisitics of the exacting-revealing.

What kind of un-concealment is it, then, that is particular to what comes to exist through this settling that exacts? Anywhere anything is set to stand by, to be immediately at hand, indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further settling. Whatever is set about in this way has its own standing. We call it the standing-reserve. The word ``standing-reserve" expresses here something more, something more essential, than mere ``stock". The name ``standing-reserve" assumes the role of an inclusive rubric. It designates no less than how all things manifest when they are wrought upon by the exacting-revealing. Whatever stands by in the sense of standing-reserve no longer stands over against us as object.

Yet an airliner that stands on the runway is surely an object. Certainly. We can represent the machine as such. But this representation conceals as to what and how the airliner is. Once revealed, it stands on the taxi strip just as standing-reserve, insofar as it is set to ensure the possibility of transportation. For this it must be, in its whole structure and in every one of its constituent parts, on call for duty, i.e., ready for takeoff. (Here it would be appropriate to discuss Hegel's definition of the machine as an autonomous tool. When applied to the tools of the craftsman, his characterization is correct. Characterized this way, however, the machine is not considered at all outside of the essence of technology that it belongs within. Seen in terms of the standing-reserve, the machine is completely unautonomous, for it has its standing only from the setting of the set-able.)

The fact that now, wherever we try to point to modern technology as the exacting revealing, the words ``settling," ``setting," ``standing-reserve," interpose and accumulate in a dry, monotonous, and therefore oppressive, way, has its basis in what is now arriving at articulation.

Who performs the exacting setting-upon through which what we call the 'real' is revealed as standing-reserve? Obviously, man. In what capacity is man capable of such a revealing? Man can indeed conceive, fashion, and carry through notions in one way or another. But man does not have control over un-concealment itself, where at any time the real may show itself or withdraw. The fact that the real shows itself in the light of Ideas, since the time of Plato, Plato did not bring about. The thinker merely responded to what spoke to him.

Only to the extent that man, for his part, is already called to exploit the energies of nature can this settling revealing happen. If man is exacted, set, to do this, then does not man himself belong, even more primitively than nature, within the standing-reserve? The current talk about human resources, about the supply of patients for a clinic, is evidence of this. The forester who, in the forest, measures the felled trees and presumably walks the same forest path as did his grandfather is today tasked by profit-making in the lumber industry, whether he knows it or not. He is subordinated to the settle-ability of cellulose, which for its part is exacted by the need for paper, which is then delivered to newspapers and magazines. The latter, in turn, set public opinion to swallowing what is printed, such that the configuration of opinion becomes available on demand. Yet precisely because man is exacted more primitively than are the energies of nature, i.e., into the process of settling, he is not transformed into standing-reserve. Since man drives technology forward, he participates in settling as a way of revealing. But the un-concealment itself, within which settling develops, is not human handiwork, no more than is the domain through which man is already passing every time he as a subject relates to an object.

Where and how does this revealing happen if it is not the handiwork of man? We needn't look far. We only need to understand, dispassionately, What has already laid claim to man has done so, so decisively that he can only be man \textit{as} the one so claimed. Wherever man opens his eyes and ears, unlocks his heart, and gives himself over to meditating and striving, shaping and working, entreating and thinking, he finds himself everywhere already arrived at the un-concealed. The un-concealment of the un-concealed has already occured whenever it brings man to the modes of revealing granted to him. When man, thus, from within un-concealment reveals what manifests, he is merely responding to the call of un-concealment even when he contradicts it. Thus when man, investigating, observing, ensnares nature as a domain of his own conception, he has already been claimed by a way of revealing that exacts him to approach even nature itself as an object of research, until even the object disappears into the objectlessness of standing-reserve.

Modern technology as a settling-revealing is, then, no merely human doing. We must understand the exacting that sets upon man to settle the real as standing-reserve as it shows itself to be. That exacting gathers man into settling. This gathering focuses man upon settling the real as standing-reserve.

What primoridally develops the mountains into mountain ranges and runs through them in their folded togetherness is the development that we call ``\textit{Ge}birg" [mountain chain].

That original development from which develop the manner that we have one kind of feelings or another we name ``\textit{Ge}m\"{u}t" [disposition].

We now name that exacting claim which gathers man toward settling the self-revealing as standing-reserve: ``\textit{Ge-stell}" [Enframing].

We dare to use this word in a sense that has been thoroughly unfamiliar up to now.

In normal usage, the word \textit{Gestell} [frame] means some kind of apparatus, e.g., a bookshelf. \textit{Gestell} is also the name for a skeleton. The employment of the word \texit{Ge-stell} [Enframing] that is now required of us seems equally eerie, say nothing of the arbitrariness with which words of a mature language are thus misused. Can anything be more strange? Surely not. Yet this strangeness results from an old habit of thinking. And indeed thinkers agree with this usage exactly at the point where thinking is the matter at hand.  We, late born, are no longer in a position to appreciate the significance of Plato's daring to use the word \textit{eidos} for what endures, present, in each and every particular thing. For \texit{eidos}, in the common speech of the time, meant the outward appearance that a visible thing offers to the physical eye. Plato exacts of this word, however, something utterly extraordinary: that it name precisely what is not, nor ever will be, perceivable with physical eyes. This is in no way the full extent of what is extraordinary here. For \textit{idea} names not only the nonsensuous aspect of what is physically visible. Aspect (\textit{idea}) names and is, also, what constitues the essence in the audible, the tasteable, the tactile, in everything that is in any way accessible. Compared with the demands that Plato makes on language and thought, in this and other instances, the use of the word \textit{Gestell} as the name for the essence of modern technology, which we now endeavor here, is almost harmless. Even so, the usage now required remains something exacting and is open to misinterpretation.

Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., exacts him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of settling, as standing-reserve. Enframing means the manner of revealing which predominates in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological. On the other hand, all those items that are so familiar to us and are standard parts of manufacturing, such as rods, pistons, and chassis, belong to the technological. The assembly itself, however, together with the aforementioned stockparts, falls within the domain of technological activity; this activity always merely responds to the challenge of Enframing -- it never constitues Enframing itself or brings Enframing about.

The word \textit{stellen} [to set upon] in the name \textit{Ge-stell} [Enframing] not only means challenging. At the same time it should preserve the suggestion of another \textit{Stellen} from which it stems, namely, that producing and presenting [\textit{Her- und Dar-stellen}] which, in the sense of \textit{poi\-{e}sis}, lets what presences come forth into unconcealment. This producing that brings forth -- e.g., the erecting of a statue in the temple precinct -- and the challenging ordering now under consideration are indeed fundamentally different, and yet they remain related in their essence. Both are ways of revealing, of \textit{al\-{e}thia}. In Enframing, that unconcealment comes to pass in conformity with which the work of modern technology reveals the real as standing-reserve. This work is therefore neither only a human activity nor a mere means within such activity. The merely instrumental, merely anthropological definition of technology is therefore in principle untenable. And it cannot be rounded out by being referred back to some metaphysical or religious explanation that undergirds it.

It remains true, nonetheless, that man in the technological age is, in a particularly striking way, challenged forth into revealing. That revealing concerns nature, above all, as the chief storehouse of the standing energy reserve. Accordingly, man's ordering attitude and behavior display themselves first in the rise of modern physics as an exact science. Modern science's way of representing pursues and entraps nature as a calculable coherence of forces. Modern physics is not experimental physics because it applies apparatus to the questioning of nature. Rather the reverse is true. Because physics, indeed already as pure theory, sets nature up to exhibit itself as a coherence of forces calculable in advance, it therefore orders its experiments precisely for the purpose of asking whether and how nature reports itself when set up in this way.

But after all, mathematical physics arose almost two centuries before technology. How, then, could it have already been set upon by modern technology and placed in its service? The facts testify to the contrary. Surely technology got under way only when it could be supported by exact physical science. Reckoned chronologically, this is correct. Thought historically, it does not hit upon the truth.

The modern physical theory of nature prepares the way first not simply for technology but for the essence of modern technology. For already in physics the challenging gathering-together into ordering revealing holds sway. But in it that gatehring does not yet come expressly to appearance. Modern physics is the hearld of Enframing, a herald whose origin is still unknown. The essence of modern technology has for a long time been concealing itself, even where power machinery has been invented, where electrical technology is in full swing, and where atomic technology is well under way.

All coming to presence, not only modern technology, keeps itself everywhere concealed to the last. Nevertheless, it remains, with respect to its holding sway, that which precedes all: the earliest. The Greek thinkers already knew of this when they said: That which is earlier with regard to the arising that holds sway becomes manifest to us men only later. That which is primally early shows itself only ultimately to men. Therefore, in the realm of thinking, a painstaking effor tot think through still more primally what was primally thought is not the absurd wish to revive what is past, but rather the sober readiness to be astounded before the coming of what is early.

Chronologically speaking, modern physical science begins in the seventeenth century. In contrast, machine-power technology develops only in the second half of the eighteenth century. But modern technology, which for chronological reckoning is the later, is, from the point of view of the essence holding sway within it, the historically earlier.

If modern physics must resign itself ever increasingly to the fact that its realm of representation remains inscrutable and incapable of being visualized, this resignation is not dictated by any committee of researchers. It is challenged forth by the rule of Enframing, which demands that nature be orderable as standing-reserve. Hence physics, in all its retreating from the representation turned only toward objects that has alone been standard until recently, will never be able to renounce this one thing: that nature reports itself in some way or other that is identifiable through calculation and that it remains orderable as a system of information. This system is determined, then, out of a causality that has changed once again. Causality now displays neither the character of the occasioning that brings forth nor the nature of the \textit{causa efficiens}, let alone that of the \textit{causa formalis}. It seems as though causality is shrinking into a reporting -- a reporting challenged forth -- of standing-reserves that must be guaranteed either simultaneously or in sequence. To this shrinking would correspond the process of growing resignation that Heisenberg's lecture depicts in so impressive a manner.*

*W. Heisenberg, ``Das Naturbild in der heutigen Physik," in \texit{Die K\"{u}nste im technischen Zeitaler} (Munich, 1954), pp. 43 ff.

Because the essence of modern technology lies in Enframing, modern technology must employ exact physical science. Through its so doing, the deceptive illusion arises that modern technology is applied physical science. This illusion can maintain itself only so long as neither the essential origin of modern science nor indeed the essence of modern technology is adequately found out through questioning.

We are questioning concerning technology in order to bring to light our relationship to its essence. The essence of modern technology shows itself in what we call Enframing. But simply to point to this is still no way to answer the question concerning technology, if to answer means to respond, in the sense of correspond, to the essence of what is being asked about.

Where do we find ourselves brought to, if now we think one step further regarding what Enframing itself actually is? It is nothing technological, nothing on the order of a machine. It is the way in which the real reveals itself as standing-reserve. Again, we ask: Does this revealing happen somewhere beyond all human doing? No. But neither does it happen exclusively \textit{in} man, or decisively \textit{through} man.

Enframing is the gathering together that belongs to that setting-upon which sets upon man and puts him in position to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. As the one who is challenged forth in this way, man stands within the one who is challenged forth in this way, man stands within the essential realm of Enframing. He can never take up a relationship to it only subsequently. Thus the question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late. But never too late comes the question as to whether we actually experience ourselves as the ones whose activities are everywhere, public and private, are challenged forth by Enframing. Above all, never too late comes to question as to whether and how we actually admit ourselves into that wherein Enframing itself comes to presence.

The essence of modern technology starts man upon the way of that revealing through which the real everywhere, more or less distinctly, becomes standing-reserve. ``To start upon a way" means ``to send" in our ordinary language. We shall call that sending-that-gathers [\textit{versammele Schicken}] which first starts man upon a way of revealing, \textit{destining} [\textit{Geschick}]. It is from out o fthis destining that the essence of all history [\textit{Geschichte}] is determined. History is neither simply the object of written chronicle nor simply the fulfillment of human activity. That activity first becomes history as something destined. And it is only the destining into objectifying representation tha tmakes the historical accessible as an object for historiography, i.e., for a science, and on this basis makes possible the current equating of the historical with that which is chronicled.

Enframing, as a challenging-forth into ordering, sends into a way of revealing. Enframing is an ordaining of destining, as is every way of revealing. Bringing-forth, \texit{po\-{e}sis}, is also a destining in this sense. Always the unconcealment of that which is goes upon a way of revealing. Always the destining of revealing holds complete sway over man. But that destining is never a fate that compesl. For man becomes truly free only insofar as he belongs to the realm of destining and so becomes one who listens and hears [\textit{H\"{o}render}], and not one who is simply constrained to obey [\textit{H\"{o}riger}].

The essence of freedom is \textit{originally} not connected with the will or even with the causality of human willing.

Freedom governs the open in the sense of the cleared and lighted up, i.e., of the revealed. It is to the ahppening of revealing, i.e., of truth, that freedom stands in the closest and most intimate kinship. All revealing belongs within a harboring and a concealing. But that which frees -- the mystery -- is concealed and always concealing itself. All revealing comes out of the open, goes into the open, and bring sinto the open. The freedo of the open consists neither in unfettered arbitrariness nor in the constraint of mere laws. Freedom is that which conceals in a way that opens to light, in whose clearing there shimmers that veil that covers what comes to presence of all truth and lets the veil appear as what veils. Freedom is the realm of the destining that at any given time starts a revealing upon its way.

The essence of modern technology lies in Enframing. Enframing belongs within the destining of revealing. These sentences express something different from the talk that we hear more frequently, to the effect that technology is the fate of our age, where ``fate" menas the inevitableness of an unalterable course.

But when we consider the essence of technology, then we experience Enframing as a destining of revealing. In this way we are already sojourning within the open space of destining, a destining that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessley against it and curse it as the work of the devil. Quite to the contrary, when we once open ourselves expressly to the \textit{essence} of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.

The essence of technology lies in Enframing. Its holding sway belongs with destining. Since destining at any give time starts man on a way of revealing, man, thus under way, is continually approaching the brink of the possibility of pursuing and pushing forward nothing but what is revealed in ordering, and of deriving all his standards on this basis. Through this the other possibility is blocked, that man might be admitted more and sooner and ever more primally to the essence of that which is unconcealed and to its unconcealment, in order tha the might experience as his essence his needed belonging to revealing.

Place between these possibilities, man is endangered from out of destining. The destining of revealing is as such, in every on eo fits modes, and therefore necessarily, \texit{danger}.

In whatever way the destining of revealing may hold sway, the unconcealment in which everything that is shows itself at any given time harbors the danger that man may quail at the unconcealed and may misinterpret it. Thus where everything that presences exhibits itself in the light of a cause-effect coherence, even God can, for representational thinking, lose all that is exalted and holy, the mysteriousness of his distance. In the light of causality, God can sink to the level of a cause, of \textit{causa efficiens}. He then becomes, even in theology, the god of the philosophers, namely, of those who define the unconcealed and the concealed in terms of the causality of making, without ever considering the essential origin of this causality.

In a similar way the unconcealment in accordance with which nature presents itself as a calculable complex of the effects of forces can indeed permit correct determinations; but precisely through these successes the danger can remain that in the midst of all that is correct the true will withdraw.

The destining of revealing is in itself not just any danger, but danger as such.

Yet when destining reigns in the mode of Enframing, it is the supreme danger. This danger attests itself to us in two ways. As soon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man evan as object, but does so, rather, exclusively as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve, then he comes to the very brink of a precipitous fall; that is, he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve. Meanwhile man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth. In this way the impression comes to prevail that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his construct. This illusion gives rise in turn to one final delusion: It seems as though man everywhere and always encounters only himself. Heisenberg has with complete correctness pointed out that the real must present itself to contemporary man in this way.* \texit{In truth, however, precisely nowhere does man today any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence}. Man stands so decisively in attendance on the challenging-forth of Enframing that he does not apprehend Enframing as a claim, that he fails to see himself as the one spoken to, and hence also fails in every way to hear in what respect he ek-sists, from out of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, and thus \textit{can never} encounter only himself.

*``Das Naturbild," pp. 60 ff.

But Enframing does not simply endanger man in his relationship to himself and to everything that is. As a destining, it banishes man into that kind of revealing which is ordering. Where this ordering holds sway, it drives out every other possibility of revealing. Above all, Enframing conceals that revealing which, in the sense of \textit{p\-{o}esis}, lets what presences come forth into appearance. As compared with that other revealing, the setting-upon that challenges forth thrusts man into a relation to that which is, that is at once antithetical and rigorously ordered. Where Enframing holds sway, regulating and securing of the standing-reserve mark all revealing. They no longer even let their own fundamental characteristic appear, namely, this revealing as such.

Thus the challenging Enframing not only conceals a former way of revealing, bringing-forth, but it conceals revealing itself and with it That wherein unconcealment, i.e., truth, comes to pass.

Enframing blocks the shining-forth and holding-sway of truth. The destining that sends into ordering is consequently the extreme danger. What is dangerous is not technology. There is no demonry in technology, but rather there is the mystery of its essence. The essence of technology, as a destining of revealing, is the danger. The transformed meaning of the word ``Enframing" will perhaps become somewhat more familiar to us now if we think Enframing in the sense of destining and danger.

The threat to man does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology. The actual threat ha already affected man in his essence. The rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.

Thus, where Enframing reigns, there is \textit{danger} in the highest sense.

> \textit{But where danger is, grows}
> \textit{The saving power also}

Let us think carefully about these words of H\"{o}lderlin. What does it mean ``to save"? Usually we think that it means only to seize hold of a thing threatened by ruin, in order to secure it in its former continuance. But the verb ``to save" says more. ``To save" is to fetch something home into its essence, in order to bring the essence for the first time into its genuine appearing. If the essence of technology, Enframing, is the extreme danger, and if there is no truth in H\"{o}lderlin's words, then the rule of Enframing cannot exhaust itself solely in blocking all lighting-up of every revaling, all appearing of truth. Rather, precisely the essence of technology must harbor in itself the growth of the saving power. But in that case, might not an adequate look into what Enframing is as a destining of revealing bring into appearnace the saving power in its arising? 

In what respect does the saving power grow there also where the danger is? Where something grows, there it takes root, from thence it thrives. Both happen concealedly and quietly and in their own time. But according to the words of the poet we have no right whatsoever to expect that there where the danger is we should be able to lay hold of the saving power immediately and without preparation. Therefore we must consider now, in advance, in what respect the saving power does most profoundly take root and thence thrive even in that wherein the exteme danger lies, in the holding sway of Enframing. In order to consider this, it is necessary, as a last step on our way, to look with yet clearer eyes into the danger. Accordingly, we must once more question concerning technology. For we have said that in technology's essence roots and thrives the saving power.

But how shall we behold the saving power in the essence of technology so long as we do not consider in what sense of ``essence" it is that Enframing is actually the essence of technology?

Thus far we have understood ``essence" in its current meaning. In the academic language of philosophy, ``essence" menas \texit{what} something is; in Latin, \textit{quid}. \texit{Quidditas}, whatness, provides the answer to the question concerning essence. For example, what pertains to all kinds of trees -- oaks, beeches, birches, firs -- is the same ``treeness". Under this inclusive genus -- the ``universal" -- fall all real and possible trees. Is then the essence of technology, Enframing, the common genus for everything technological? If that were the case then the steam turbine, the radio transmitter, and the cyclotron would each be an Enframing. But the word ``Enframing" does not mean here a tool or any kind of apparatus. Still less does it mean the general concept of such resources. The machines and apparatus are no more cases and kinds of Enframing than are the man at the switchboard and the engineer in the drafting room. Each of these in its own way indeed belongs as stockpart, available resource, or executer, within Enframing; but Enframing is never the essence of technology in the sense of a genus. Enframing is a way of revealing having the character of destining, namely, the way that challenges forth. The revealing that brings forth (\textit{p\-{o}esis}) is also a way that has the character of destining. But these ways are not kinds that , arrayed beside one another, fall under the concept of revealing. Revealing is that destining which, ever suddenly and inexplicably to all thinking, apportions to itself into the revealing that brings forth and that also challenges, and which allots itself to man. The challenging revealing has its origin as a destining in bringing-forth. But at the same time Enframing, in a way characteristic of a destining, blocks \textit{p\-{o}esis}.

Thus Enframing, as a destining of revealing, is indeed the essence of technology, but never in the sense of genus and \textit{essentia}. If we pay heed to this, something astounding strikes us: It is technology itself that makes the demand on us to think in another way what is usually understood by ``essence". But in what way?

If we speak of the ``essence of a house" and the ``essence of a state," we do not mean a generic type; rather we mean the ways in which house and state hold sway, administer themselves, develop and decay - the way in which they ``essence" [\textit{Wesen}]. Johann Peter Hebel in a poem, ``Ghost on Kanderer Street," for which Goethe had a special fondness, uses the old word \textit{die Weserei}. It means the city hall inasmuch as there the life of the community gathers and village existence is constantly in play, i.e., comes to presence. It is from the verb \textit{wesen} that the noun is derived. \textit{Wesen} understood as a verb is the same as \textit{w\"{a}hren} [to last or endure], not only in terms of meaning, but also in terms of the phonetic formation of the word. Socrates and Plato already think the essence of something as what essences, what comes to presence, in the sense of what endures. But they think what endures as what remains permanently [\textit{das Fortw\"{a}hrende}] (\textit{aei on}). And they find what endures permanently in what, as that which remains, tenaciously persists throughout all that happens. That which remains they discover, in turn, in the aspect [\textit{Aussehen}] (\textit{eidos, idea}), for example, the Idea ``house."

The Idea ``house" displays what anything is that is fashioned as a house. Particular, real, and possible houses, in contrast, are changing and transitory derivatives of the Idea and thus belong to what does not endure.

But it can never in any way be established that enduring is based solely on what Plato thinks as \textit{idea} and Aristotle thinks as \textit{to ti \-{e}n einai} (that which any particular thing has always been), or what metaphysics in its most varied interpreations thinks as \textit{essentia}.

All essencing endures. But is enduring only permanent enduring? Does the essence of technology endure in the sense of the permanent enduring of an Idea that hovers over everything technological, thus making it seem that by technology we mean some mythological abstraction? The way in which technology essences lets itself be seen only from out of that permanent enduring in which Enframing comes to pass as a destining of revealing. Goethe once uses the mysterious word \textit{fortgew\"{a}hren} [to grant permanently] in place of \textit{fortw\"{a}hren} [to endure permanently].* He hears \textit{w\"{a}hren} [to endure] and \textit{gew\"{a}hren} [to grant] here in one unarticulated accord. And if we now ponder more carefully than we did before what it is that actually endures and perhaps alone endures, we may venture to say: \textit{Only what is granted endures. That which endures primally out of the earliest beginning is what grants}. 

*``Die Wahlverwandtschaften" [Congeniality], pt II, chap. 10, in the novelette \textit{Die wunderlichen Nachbaskinder} [The strange neighbor's children].

As the essencing of technology, Enframing is that which endures. Does Enframing hold sway at all in the sense of granting? No doubt the question seems a horrendous blunder. For according to everything that has been said, Enframing is, rather, a destining that gatehrs together into the revealing that challenges forth. Challenging is anything but a granting. So it seems, so long as we do not notices that the challenging-forth into the ordering of the real as standing-reserve still remains a destining that starts man upon a way of revealing. As this destining, the coming to presence of technology gives man entry into That which, of himself, he can neither invent nor in any way make. For there is no such thing as a man who, solely of himself, is only man.

But if this destining, Enframing, is the extreme danger, not only for man's coming to prsence, but for all revealing as such, should this destining still be called a granting? Yes, most emphatically,...
